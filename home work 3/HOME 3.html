<h1>
    Prince Arthas Menethil
</h1>


<div class="joj">

    <p>
        was born four years before the First War in the family of King Terenas Menethil II. The
        young prince grew up at a time when the lands of all of Azeroth were permeated by war, the Alliance was in
        turmoil, and dark clouds were still looming on the horizon.

        Arthas' martial arts were taught by Muradin Bronzebeard himself, brother of the dwarven king Magni Bronzebeard.
        Arthas succeeded in this endeavor and became an expert swordsman. Under the auspices of Uther the Lightbringer,
        Arthas entered the Knights of the Silver Hand at the age of 19. Despite his recklessness and stubbornness,
        Arthas became a renowned warrior. One of his most famous exploits was the counterattack against the trolls who
        attacked Quel'Thalas from Zul'Aman.

        Difficulties began to overwhelm Azeroth. The Orcs escaped from their camps, and news of a plague attacking the
        northern lands spread quickly. Arthas and Uther were sent to Stranbrad to defend the city from orcish raids. The
        young prince defeated the black dragon Gorinoks and took his heart, which he later gave to the dwarf Feranor
        Ironfoot, who forged a fire sphere. Arthas used this magical orb to slay the leader of the orc raids.

        However, the plague posed a much greater threat. Jaina and Captain Falric were sent to reinforce Arthas, now 23,
        to investigate the mysterious plague together. Fighting an army of the dead, they encountered the necromancer
        Kel'Thuzad near the town of Brill and pursued him to Andorhal.

        Kel'Thuzad had already infected all the grain stored in Andorhal and sent it to nearby villages. Before dying at
        the hands of Arthas, Kel'Thuzad spoke of Mal'Ganis, who was leading the Scourge. Jaina and Arthas traveled north
        to fight him in Stratholme.
