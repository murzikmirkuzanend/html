<h2 class="sss">EVEN THE SCURVIEST OF PIRATES HAVE RULES</h2>
<p class="xxx mmm">
    From the very beginning, we've been determined to make Sea of Thieves a truly welcoming world in which
    players of any creed, culture, age, skill level and circumstance can voyage without fear of friction or frustration.
    With that in mind, we've laid out a set of guidelines that we hope will help to keep the seas free of strife and
    grievance (beyond that stirred up in the course of a pirate's everyday activities).

    The sacred bond between crewmates should never be broken, but even when waging war across the decks of rival
    raiders, all crews should ultimately hold one another in respect. So here for you to read, reflect upon and remember
    is the Sea of Thieves Pirate Code!</p>
